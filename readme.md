My email development process has changes significantly since I created this repository. 

I use MailChimp and Mandrill as my Email Service Provider. The templates here work out of the box with those providers but could be easily modified to work with others.

Below are some resources I've collected that have helped me in my email development process.

## Inspiration
Some great resources for getting inspired.

* http://reallygoodemails.com/
* http://inspiration.mailchimp.com/

## Development
### Resources
* http://www.emailology.org/ – Hasn't been updated in a while, but has some great resources.
* https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate/ – hasn't been updated in a while, but still has some good pointers.
* https://stamplia.com/ - Email template marketplace
* http://litmus.com/

### Components / Tools
* https://www.sendwithus.com/resources/components – some great snippets
* https://github.com/premailer/premailer – CSS inliner. MailChimp, Mandrill, and most ESPs do this automatically. However, if you push transactional emails from a web app that uses plain SMTP there is a rails gem which allows you to more easily create nice looking HTML emails from your web app.
* http://buttons.cm/ – HTML button generator
